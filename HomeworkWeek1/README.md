I made my first homework today. I almost spend 7-8 hours to make it. I also couldn't figure out exactly how to make dropdown nav menu with flex. So I made it via traditional methods.

Other thinh I would like mention is that I push this homework folder via gitbash to my git repository allocated for my homework assignments. 

I also create this README.md file via gitbash by commanding gitbash "touch READMEmd". After that I write this text inside README.md file via VÄ°M.

I will focus on particularly flexbox. And after that how to make responsive my website.
