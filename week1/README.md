# mypersonalwebsite
Hello. Before apply to Hack Your Future next class #4 which starts from 17 March 2019, I would like to make something prior to that illustrates my motivation to participate your course apart from finishing just only codecademy online course. 

I am very motivated and really wanted to join your class, because it is vital for me to continue my life in Belgium in an area that I am passionate about.

I know and realized that this  trial personal website has lots of errors. 

But since I just only started to study in this area, (2-3 weeks ago), now I can definitely say that If  given a chance I will show amazing extraordinary success.

Thanks in advance.
 Kind regards.
